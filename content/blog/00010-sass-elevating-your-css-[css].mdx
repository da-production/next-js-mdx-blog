Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS with powerful features, making stylesheets more maintainable and easier to write.

### What is Sass?

Sass allows developers to write CSS in a more dynamic way by providing features like variables, nesting, and mixins. It compiles down to standard CSS, which can be used in any web project.

### Key Features of Sass

- **Variables:** Sass allows you to define variables that can store values such as colors, fonts, or any CSS property. This makes it easy to maintain and update styles.
  
  ```scss
  $primary-color: #3498db;
  body {
    background-color: $primary-color;
  }
  ```
