CSS Grid Layout has revolutionized web design by providing a two-dimensional layout system that allows developers to create complex, responsive layouts with minimal effort.

### What is CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is a layout system that enables developers to divide a webpage into rows and columns, creating a grid-based layout. This flexibility allows for precise control over the placement and sizing of elements.

### Key Features of CSS Grid

- **Two-Dimensional Layouts:** Unlike Flexbox, which is primarily one-dimensional, CSS Grid can manage both rows and columns simultaneously, making it ideal for complex designs.
- **Explicit and Implicit Grids:** Developers can define explicit grid templates or allow the browser to create implicit grids based on content size, providing great flexibility.
- **Responsive Design:** CSS Grid works seamlessly with media queries, making it easy to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes.

### Using CSS Grid in Practice

To create a simple grid layout, you can define a grid container and specify the number of rows and columns. Hereâ€™s a basic example:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: auto;
  gap: 10px;
}
