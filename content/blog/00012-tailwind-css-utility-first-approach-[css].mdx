Tailwind CSS has gained popularity for its utility-first approach to styling, allowing developers to build custom designs without leaving their HTML.

### What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of predefined classes to help developers style their applications directly within their markup. This approach reduces the need for custom CSS files and promotes a more streamlined workflow.

### Key Features of Tailwind CSS

- **Utility Classes:** Tailwind provides low-level utility classes for common styling needs, such as margins, padding, colors, and typography. This enables rapid prototyping and design.

  ```html
  <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4">
    Hello, Tailwind!
  </div>
  ```
