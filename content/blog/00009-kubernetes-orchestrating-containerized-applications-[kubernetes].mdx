Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration, enabling developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform developed by Google that automates the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers. It manages clusters of hosts running Linux containers, providing a robust framework for managing containerized applications.

### Key Features of Kubernetes

- **Automatic Scaling:** Kubernetes can automatically scale applications up or down based on demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
- **Self-Healing:** If a container fails, Kubernetes automatically restarts it or replaces it, ensuring high availability.
- **Load Balancing:** Kubernetes distributes traffic across containers to ensure that no single container becomes a bottleneck.

### Getting Started with Kubernetes

To get started with Kubernetes, you typically deploy a cluster using a cloud provider or local setup (like Minikube). Hereâ€™s a simple YAML configuration for deploying a web application:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web-app
        image: my-web-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
