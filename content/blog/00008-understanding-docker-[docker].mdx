Docker has become a cornerstone of modern application deployment, enabling developers to create, deploy, and run applications in isolated containers.

### What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. These containers encapsulate an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across environments.

### Key Features of Docker

- **Isolation:** Each container runs in its own environment, preventing conflicts between applications and their dependencies.
- **Portability:** Docker containers can run on any machine that has Docker installed, making it easy to move applications between development, testing, and production environments.
- **Scalability:** Docker makes it simple to scale applications by deploying multiple containers across different machines.

### Getting Started with Docker

To get started with Docker, you first need to install it on your machine. Once installed, you can create a Dockerfile to define your application’s environment. Here’s a simple example for a Node.js app:

```dockerfile
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
